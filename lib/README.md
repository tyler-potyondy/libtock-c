libtock-c `lib` Directory
=========================

This folder is a storage location for `libtock-c`-specific compiled libraries
useful for building `libtock-c` apps.

For convenience and to avoid large files in the repository, many libraries are
pre-compiled and downloaded automatically by the build system. Those
pre-compiled libraries are stored here after the build system compiles apps that
need particular libraries.
