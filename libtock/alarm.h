/** @file alarm.h
 * @brief Alarm function prototypes
 *
 * The alarm module allows the client to initiate alarms and receive
 * callbacks when those alarms have expired. Clients can set one-shot alarms to
 * fire at particular clock values (`alarm_at`)
 *
 * The client should not assume anything about the underlying clock used by an
 * implementation other than that it is running at sufficient frequency to
 * deliver at least millisecond granularity and that it is a 32-bit clock (i.e.
 * it will wrap at 2^32 clock ticks).
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 *     static void callback(int now, int interval, int arg2, char* str) {
 *       printf("%s\n", str);
 *     }
 *
 *     uint32_t frequency = alarm_internal_frequency();
 *     uint32_t now = alarm_now();
 *     static alarm_t alarm;
 *     alarm_at(now + frequency, callback, (void*)"1 second elapsed", &alarm);
 *
